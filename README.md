## Introduction

Join me on a journey through the intricate landscape of model selection, bias, and variance. Through a series of illuminating examples, we delve into the concepts of overfitting and underfitting using polynomial data and uninformative features, providing a nuanced understanding of model complexity.

Uncover the fundamental principles of bias and variance and their implications for linear regression and beyond. Through practical demonstrations, gain insights into how these factors shape the performance and robustness of machine learning models.

Explore advanced model selection techniques, including K-Fold Cross-Validation and the 1-SE rule to navigate the delicate balance between bias and variance. Equip yourself with the knowledge and tools needed to make informed decisions when selecting models that best fit your data and objectives.

## Environment Setup

**Prerequisites**: Ensure Python 3.6 or newer is installed on your system.

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
    - Install `virtualenv` if you prefer it over the built-in `venv` (optional):
        ```bash
        pip install virtualenv
        ```
    - Create the environment:
        - With `venv` (Python 3.3+):
            ```bash
            python -m venv env
            ```
        - Or, with `virtualenv`:
            ```bash
            virtualenv env
            ```
    - Activate the environment:
        - Windows: `env\Scripts\activate`
        - Unix/MacOS: `source env/bin/activate`
    - To deactivate: `deactivate`

2. **Dependencies**:
    Ensure all dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`. Install them using:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
